# Inprocode | Wellness App

This project includes building a Node.js API with a MySQL database to store data and a develop dynamic frontend built with React.

### 📄 Node.js API Development:

- A RESTful API was designed and implemented using Node.js to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend of the application.
- The API feature endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting data, ensuring full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.
- A MySQL database was utilized for data storage, allowing management and organization of information generated by the application.

### 📄 MySQL Database Integration:

- The MySQL database was integrated with the Node.js API, providing solution for storing user-generated data, metrics, and other relevant information.
- Migration scripts was created for setting up initial database structures and data, making it easy to manage updates and changes moving forward.

### 📄 Interactive React Application:

- A user-friendly React application was be developed, featuring a variety of interactive components to enhance user experience.
- Key components included:
  -Interactive Map: A map visualization tool that allows users to explore geographic data, mark locations, and interact with map elements to gain insights.
  - Dynamic Calendar: A calendar interface that enables users to track events, appointments, and important dates with the ability to manipulate events through intuitive drag-and-drop functionality.
  - Data Table: A sortable and filterable table that presents data in an organized manner, allowing users to view, edit, and delete entries in a user-friendly format.
  - Charts and Graphs: Visualization components that provide users with quick insights into trends and patterns in the data.
